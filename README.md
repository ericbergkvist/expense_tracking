# expensesTrackingRust

Manage and analyse CSV expenses using a Rust codebase.

## Usage

At the moment, run `cargo run` in the `expenses_tracking` folder.

## Todos (and vision)

- Function to rename categories and sub-categories
- Each category and sub-category needs a date associated with it, such that data analysis can in the future account for it.
  - Edge-case: how should we deal with a (sub-)category that was created, then deleted at some point, and then recreated? We would then need more than a start and end date. Should it be a vector of dates?
  - It might make sense to make categories and sub-categories structs (attributes: name, date of creation, date of deletion?)

## Missing features

### Â General

- Would be nice to work in a container
- Debugger not working

### Tests

- Once we can write transactions to a CSV, we should ensure that reading a transaction, then
  creating a category out of it, and then adding it to the expense tracker actually adds it. Then
  we could test writing it back to a CSV and compare (result will be lower case at the moment, keep
  it in mind)
- Test config creation using an example CSV

### Refactoring

- Use `map_err()` instead of `match` statements to make error handling less verbose
- General errors (`Box<dyn Error>`) are used everywhere and should be replaced when it makes sense
